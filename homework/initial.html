        <p><strong>Name of the reviewer:</strong> Monica McGary <br>
        <strong>Peer review:</strong> "Sam,Your designs look good, the only thing I have a question about  are the headers for the Today column? Just add some headers and you should be good." <br>
        <strong>Response:</strong> I followed Monica's counsel to add headers. With that, it sparked some ideas and I added the temperatures to the 'Today's Forecast' and 'Weekly Forecast.'<br> I also added a spot for an image of the weather conditions of states across the U.S.
