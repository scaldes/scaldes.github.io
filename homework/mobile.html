    <h3>Visitor Analysis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>After mobile browsing in <a href="http://www.forever21.com/" title="Forever21's website homepage">Forever21</a>, my thoughts were that is was very simple to use, I could still see what I wanted
            <br> and everything was nicely layed out.</li>
        <li>I was able to find what I was looking for thanks to the links at the top and the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>I was able to do what I wanted to do, which was to search for clothing.</li>
        <li>The only frustration with mobile browsing was the constant scrolling.</li>
        <li>Although this website was adjusted nicely to a small screen, I feel that it works better when on a computer screen.</li>
    </ul>

            <li>The age demographic for Forever 21 are aimed at mid teens to mid 20's with an income of approximately $30,000. The education
                <br> level portrayed in the clothing are both sophisticated and casual. Due to the look of the clthoing style choice,
                <br> the geographical location most fit for this is urban more than rural. </li>
            <li>This website does a great job in response to the audience's needs. The content wanted from this website is to know the prices
                <br> of clothings, new offers, etc. Although the clothing looks more urban, according to the site, there are multiple store locations
                <br> therefore, shipping should not be a problem. </li>
            <li>The content is well organized and easy to be found because there are links located at the top of the page which includes a drop down menu
                <br> next to the search bar.</li>
            <li>My mobile browsing experiece was plesant because when the website shrank to a mobile device, it was still appealing to the eye. </li>
            <li>This site really does facilitate people by adjusting to a mobile environment, allowing the user to avoid zooming in. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Persona</h3> <img src="/images/persona.jpg" alt="An image of the target audience" height="150">
        <ul>
            <li>Emma is 21, lives in Los Angeles,CA and loves to shop. Although shopping can lead to serious debt, she needs to find
                <br> a clothing store where the prices are affordable yet have great quality.</li>
            <li>Her goal is to be viewed as sophisticated but casual in her appearnce. She drives a Sedan and has a full-time job, therefore
                <br> she needs her items to be shipped to avoid spending more gas money and missing work.</li>

        <h3>Site Contrast</h3> <em>Worst website</em>
        <br>
        <br> <img src="/images/bad%20website%20ex.png" title="An image of the worst website" width="150">
        <p><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="http://www.libertyvan.com/" title="Liberty Van's website homepage"> Libertyvan.com</a></p>
        <ol>
            <li> It was very difficult to know who the target audience was. It was hard enough to try to figure out what the website was about.
                <br>After much reading and pondering, then I could faintly pick out the intended audience. </li>
            <li>This website does not meet the needs of the audience because it is very difficult to navigate content. Visually, it is very unappealing
                <br> therefore hard to satisfy the audience's requirements.</li>
            <li>Liberty Van did not do a good in organizing their content because everything seems to mix in. Although they bolded some titles,
                <br> they did not make it apparent and clear.</li>
            <li>The site did not facilitate visitors in the mobile environment because the text runs over the images.</li>
        </ol>
