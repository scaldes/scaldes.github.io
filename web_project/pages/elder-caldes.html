                    <h2>WEEK 1:</h2>
                    <p>So the flight to mexico was long and rough cuz of the stromy weather but we got there safely. waited with the driver of the mtc (ccm) for more missionaries We drove past the temple and caught a glimpse of it and its beautiful! </p>
                    <p>We arrived at the CCM and it turned out that we were the smallest group ever to arrive at so they called us the chosen ones! We all have different personalities but somehow it works out because we get along pretty well and i consider these guys my brothers! The sisters in my district are the best!</p>
                    <p> Everyday we:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> wake up </li>
                        <li>eat and</li>
                        <li>study constantly</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> which has been a blessing in my life both spiritually and physically with portioned meals and set times to study and excercise which is awesome!</p>
                    <p> I am grateful for the oppurtunity to be able to serve a mission and ive already seen the blessing its been on my life as i feel happy and energetic every single day no matter what! If you guys want to know more details about specific things that happen to me from jokes to lessons that ive taught just ask becasue there is so much that goes on and such little time! Thursday is my PDAY so ill always answer but untill next Thursday! </p>

                    <p class="red">Today was a great week at the CCM! We had a great sunday devotional by Richard G. Scott about prayer and it was something i really needed to hear which was cool. Also we watched Meet The Mormons and it was kind of sad for all the missionaries as you could here every elder and hermana sobbing haha! </p>
                    <p>Anyways the rest of the week was business as usual:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>constant studying and</li>
                        <li>teaching in spanish</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> Monday for family home evening i showed the district how to play "if, then" and we had alot of fun! Tuesday we had another devotional by an area seventy. Miercoles is always the toughest day of the week because its PDay eve which means we are all distracted and we just want the day to end! Pday always consists of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>picture taking</li>
                        <li>basketball</li>
                        <li>volleyball</li>
                        <li>emailing and</li>
                        <li>napping</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> so today has been a successfull day! Till next week!</p>
