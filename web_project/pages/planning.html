                    <p>The purpose of my project is to document my brotherâ€™s mission experiences in Lubbock, Texas. The delivered content will involve his weekly emails primarily on his photographs, adventures, and his testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It is also to help others learn more about Jesus Christ come closer to Him through content in the website.</p>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The target audience of my website is for all past, present and future missionaries for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It also includes missionary families and those interested in the church or learning more about Jesus Christ. Their wants and needs are to learn more about missionary work, tips and tricks in order to be a more effective missionary, and read personal accounts from a missionary currently serving with the hardships and blessings that come from it.</p>
